My name is Mark Roepke and I am a data scientist primarily interested in solving problems using R. While most of my professional work is related to supervised and unsupervised machine learning, I use R and other programming languages to learn other things on my own time.

I am originally from Findlay, OH, but moved to Cincinnati to attend Xavier University. I still live and work in Cincinnati, and I am a huge fan of the Xavier University Musketeers and FC Cincinnati. My girlfriend Sophie and I met at Xavier during our freshman orientation, and I regularly visit her in Indianapolis where she lives and works.

I built this website because I thought I wanted to learn `blogdown`, and I'm planning to use it as exposure for the data science-related projects I complete in my free time.
