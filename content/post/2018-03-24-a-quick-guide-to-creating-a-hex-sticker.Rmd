In my [first post](https://www.markroepke.me/post/introducing-flxr-an-r-package-to-retrieve-movie-data/) I introduced `flxr`, a basic R package I wrote to retrieve basic movie data from the web. Because any respectable R package has a hex sticker, I decided to put my design skills to the test and create one for `flxr`. This is an overview of that process that can hopefully be followed by those wanting to create their own hex sticker.

## `hexSticker` Package

I had no idea where to begin in creating a hex sticker for `flxr`, but I immediately thought there could be an R package for creating hex stickers and I was correct. [Guangchuang Yu](https://twitter.com/guangchuangyu) created the [hexSticker package](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) to enable R users to easily create hex stickers for various purposes. The README on the package's GitHub page gives a great overview and displays stickers users have made with the package, which is great for sharing and inspiration!

The `hexSticker` package is on CRAN, so it can easily be installed and loaded:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("hexSticker")
library(hexSticker)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(hexSticker)
```

## Obtaining a Sticker Feature

The next step in creating a hex sticker is to determine its "feature", a central object that is the focus of the sticker. It's a good idea to make the feature a representation of the purpose of the R package. For example, the `dplyr` sticker has pliers as its feature:

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "/img/dplyr-sticker.png">
</p>

In a similar spirit, I decided to use a clip art image of a movie camera for `flxr` given that it scrapes data about movies:

<p align = "center">
  <img width = "25%" height = "25%" src = "/img/flxr-camera.png">
</p>

If you do not wish to use an image as the feature of your sticker, there are other examples available on the `hexSticker` GitHub page.

## Creating the Sticker

The `sticker()` function in the `hexSticker` package is used for actually creating a sticker. It automatically creates the hexagonal shape and correct size, as well as provides a default template as a starting point. However, it's the default is not extremely detailed and it's likely easier to edit something more detailed. The code I used to create the `flxr` sticker is below:

```{r eval = FALSE}
sticker(
  package = "flxr",                     # package name to display on sticker             
  p_size = 24,                          # size of package name
  p_y = 1.5,                            # y of package name
  p_color = "#C9B128",                  # color of package name
  subplot = "base_camera.png",          # sticker feature
  s_x = 1.085,                          # x of feature
  s_y = .8,                             # y of feature
  s_width = .48,                        # width of feature - maintains aspect ratio
  h_size = 2,                           # border
  h_color = "#C9B128",                  # color of border
  h_fill = "black",                     # color of background
  url = "github.com/markroepke/flxr",   # url at the bottom
  u_color = "white",                    # color of url at the bottom
  u_size = 3.5,                         # size of url at the bottom
  filename = "flxr.png"                 # location to save the image
)
```

Note that the sticker image created by the `sticker()` function does not display in the plot or viewer window within RStudio, but it does save to the location specified in the `filename` parameter.

Here is the sticker I've created for `flxr`, which is a direct result of the above code:

<p align = "center">
  <img width = "25%" height = "25%" src = "/img/flxr-sticker.png">
</p>

Hopefully this is a decent guide for quickly creating a hex sticker with the `hexSticker` R package. I would like to play around with this some more to better understand the package's full functionality.
